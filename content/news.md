Below is a letter from Barbara Dembińska, who is a member both of our Society and of the Polish "Friends". As you will read, her father was Commander Tadeusz Lesisz (renowned Gunnery officer on the Ship during the Cowes Blitz). I believe that quite a number of our members are descendants of the Błyskawica's officers or crew, and may well be interested in joining in with Barbara's and Stanisław's very worthwhile project.

Barbara's e-mail address is: biba.dembinska@gmail.com

No e-mail? please send your information to 6 Albert Way, East
Cowes, Isle of Wight, PO32 6GB. Margaret Prior.

 "Hello,I am the daughter of the late Commander Tadeusz Lesisz who took part in the defence of Cowes on ORP Błyskawica on the night of 4 May 1942 as gunnery officer.
I would like to draw your attention to a campaign (a petition) launched by Stanisław Feruś, (whose Uncle served on the ORP Błyskawica during World War II) to commemorate the sailors from the World War II period who served on the ship.
The petition was initiated primarily because the ORP Błyskawica museum in Gdynia displays no list of crew, no photos, no tangible sign of those brave sailors who manned the guns, the engines, the galleys and the bridge during the war. It mentions only the Captains and those who perished.
The aim is for the ORP Błyskawica Society (The friends of Ship Museum Society in Gdynia) to support our request by placing the names of all the sailors, together with their photographs and brief biographies, aboard the ship itself and on the Society’s internet page, as well as at the Polish Naval Museum in Gdynia, on the museum’s media browser and webpage.
 
 As you can imagine this is a huge undertaking because first of all, we must collect as much information from former crew members' families as possible.
On 7 September I officially joined the Society’s Board and am now actively involved in this project.
I am hoping you may be able to help as I know that you may have amassed a lot of information about a family member who served on board the Ship. What I am looking for is:
Photograph - portrait (preferably in uniform), date and place of birth, date of death and place of burial, short description of service, on what ships, time served in the Polish Navy (from when to when), list of medals and orders.
I would be pleased to hear from you with any information." Barbara Dembińska
